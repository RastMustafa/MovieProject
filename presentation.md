# Movie Project Presentations

This time, we will be a bit stricter about time (also there's no madlibs filling
out this time). Eight minutes per group.

## Part 1: Demo
Demo your project. Show us the pages. Maximum three minutes.

## Part 2: Explain some code.
Each person explain **one** piece of code. About 1.5 minutes per person.

## Part 3: Learning.
Approximately one minute per person.

* How was the experience of reading pre-existing code?
* What was the hardest thing for you in the project?
// I think its the github and mergeing issues , 
// and how to map the project
// I can say its not hard at all as a codeing as much hard as manging like in my case I foget to commit and push  Pull reques new updates 
//  which lead to unsolvable conflects code.
// anothrer hadship was the  styling part I think for me .
